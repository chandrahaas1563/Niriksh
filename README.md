# Niriksh-Edge-AI-Defect-Classification-for-Semiconductor-Images

An **Edge-AI–ready deep learning system** for **automatic detection and classification of semiconductor wafer and die defects**.  
This project was developed for a hackathon and focuses on **high-accuracy, efficient inference** using **MobileNetV3** and export to **ONNX** for deployment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Develop an Edge-AI capable system that can automatically detect and classify defects in semiconductor wafer and die images using AI/ML techniques. The solution must operate reliably in real time on low-power edge hardware, reflecting the practical constraints of semiconductor manufacturing environments.

# Phase: 1

## 🧠 Problem Understanding

Semiconductor manufacturing requires **fast, accurate, and reliable inspection** of wafers and dies to improve yield and reduce waste.  
Manual inspection or cloud-based systems introduce:
- Latency
- Higher operational cost
- Limited scalability

This project aims to design a **compact, accurate, and deployable AI model** that can:
- Perform defect classification automatically
- Be exported to ONNX for edge deployment
- Maintain high accuracy with low computational overhead

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Created a custom dataset with **7000+ images**
   - Classes:
     - `BRIDGES`, `CRACK`, `OPENS`, `CMP`, `LER`, `VIAS`, `GOOD`, `OTHERS`
   - Applied data augmentation:
     - Brightness variation
     - Contrast adjustment
     - Rotation
   - Images resized to **224×224**

2. **Model Selection**
   - Chosen **MobileNetV3-Large** due to:
     - Low parameter count
     - High efficiency on edge devices
     - Strong accuracy–latency trade-off

3. **Training Strategy**
   - Transfer learning using pre-trained MobileNetV3
   - Stage 1: Train classification head with frozen backbone
   - Stage 2: Fine-tune the full network

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Exported trained model to **INT16 ONNX**
   - Evaluated using **ONNX Runtime on CPU**
